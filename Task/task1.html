    <h4>
      Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum that sits gracefully on the
      pedestal of Agra with its perfect image mirrored in the reflection pool in
      front of it giving it a surreal appearance. It is said that the place
      changes color by reflecting the ever-changing hues of the sky during
      different weather, seasons, and times of the day. The changing colors of
      the walls make the mausoleum feel like an alive and enchanted symbol of
      love.

      The Taj Mahal is often called the "epitome of Mughal architecture" and was
      acknowledged as the "jewel of Muslim art" by UNESCO. This article
      discusses the architecture of this majestic World Wonder in-depth so that
      you know what to look for when visiting yourself.

    <h2>Top 5 Features of Taj Mahal Architecture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Taj Mahal emits a sense of peace and harmony which is mainly caused
        by the structure's near-perfect symmetry, the main dome and surrounding
        minarets, and the division of the gardens by four canals that meet at a
        raised central lotus pond.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        To achieve the desired other-worldly experience, the Taj Mahal's
        minarets are placed in a specific way to create an optical illusion.
        Because the architects and craftsmen were masters of proportions, they
        were able to build the monument in such a way that as soon as you enter
        the gate, the monument appears close and large. But as you approach it,
        it shrinks in size.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        The hierarchal use of stones and colors in the building of the Taj Mahal
        adds many layers to its meaning. Before the Taj was built, red sandstone
        was used in most Mughal architecture, but Shah Jahan was greatly
        influenced by Hindu color coding for different castes. By taking the
        liberty of using white stone reserved for Brahmins (priestly caste) and
        Red Stone reserved for Kshatriyas (warrior caste) the Mughals identified
        with India's two leading classes and announced themselves as their
        rulers.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        In order to add a holy aura to the place, the walls of the monument are
        covered with beautiful calligraphy and pietra dura. Pietra dura is a
        method of inlaying marble with precious stones like amber, coral, jade,
        and lapis lazuli. Since Islam condemns anthropomorphic art, the walls
        are carefully decorated with abstract art and vegetative motifs.
        Multiple techniques are used for the adornment of these walls including;
        mosaic art, murals, and incised painting.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        The use of one central dome has been a part of Mughal architecture for a
        long time. The dome of the Taj Mahal is a classic Persian dome. There
        are actually two main domes in the Taj Mahal including an outer dome
        built over an inner dome, in between the two is a large concealed empty
        space. The double dome technique is used for the aesthetics and appeal
        of the inner chamber and to retain correct proportions. When Put
        together, the double dome structure signifies the heavenward elevation
        of the soul.
